abstract = {{Single-atom serve as catalysts (SAC) with intriguing properties, offering a balance between heterogeneous and homogeneous properties. While their heterogeneous nature has been extensively explored, the role of the scaffold as a ligand remains obscure but severely affects the metal electronic structure. In this study, we employ density functional theory to investigate the electronic properties of single-atom catalysts supported on nitrogen-doped carbon, focusing on the extensively used transition metal centers: Fe, Ni, Cu, and Pd. Our analysis includes metrics such as Bader charges, the metal d-band center, and the Fermi level, focusing on the coordination environment of the transition metal center and analyzing the influence of the nitrogen content on these properties. We utilized dimensionality reduction techniques to identify similar electronic configurations. Our findings reveal that the SACs electronic structure predominantly exhibits metal cations with free-atom-like d-states, with the coordination environment’s significance outweighing the metal nature, and further influenced by nitrogen content and type. Ultimately, our study underscores the ability to finely tune the host to adapt to reactivity, offering insights into the continuous modulation of electronic structures.}},

abstract = {{Highly efficient and cost-effective photocatalysts are among the most prominent targets in the field of environmental remediation and clean energy production. Here, we report that 2D/2D layer heterostructures composed of exfoliated Ni-doped MoS2 nanosheets and g-C3N4 layers can carry out photocatalytic Cr(VI) reduction in aqueous solutions with outstanding activity, exhibiting apparent QYs as high as 29.6 \% and 23.7 \% at 375 and 410 nm. We show that Ni doping of MoS2 markedly increases the photochemical activity, which, together with electrochemical, spectroscopic and theoretical DFT studies, arises from the enhanced carrier density and mobility at the Ni-MoS2/g-C3N4 interface. In addition to the favorable charge transport properties, delineation of the photoinduced oxidation reactions by gas monitoring techniques reveals that the high efficiency also arises from fast water oxidation kinetics. The results of this work mark an important step forward in understanding and designing low-cost and earth-abundant catalysts for detoxification of Cr(VI)-contaminated industrial effluents.}},
