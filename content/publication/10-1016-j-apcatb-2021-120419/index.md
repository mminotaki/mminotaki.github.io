abstract: Highly efficient and cost-effective photocatalysts are among the most prominent
  targets in the field of environmental remediation and clean energy production. Here,
  we report that 2D/2D layer heterostructures composed of exfoliated Ni-doped MoS2
  nanosheets and g-C3N4 layers can carry out photocatalytic Cr(VI) reduction in aqueous
  solutions with outstanding activity, exhibiting apparent QYs as high as 29.6 % and
  23.7 % at 375 and 410 nm. We show that Ni doping of MoS2 markedly increases the
  photochemical activity, which, together with electrochemical, spectroscopic and
  theoretical DFT studies, arises from the enhanced carrier density and mobility at
  the Ni-MoS2/g-C3N4 interface. In addition to the favorable charge transport properties,
  delineation of the photoinduced oxidation reactions by gas monitoring techniques
  reveals that the high efficiency also arises from fast water oxidation kinetics.
  The results of this work mark an important step forward in understanding and designing
  low-cost and earth-abundant catalysts for detoxification of Cr(VI)-contaminated
  industrial effluents.
